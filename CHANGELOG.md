## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

First public release. WeftDB is pre-beta: the API will change, and the version
number says so.

### Added

- **Interpolation as a first-class query.** Ask for any resolution and get back a
  continuous series, reconstructed with the spline method you choose (linear,
  quadratic, cubic, polynomial), computed on SIMD/parallel CPU or GPU (`wgpu`).
- **Provenance labelling.** Every returned point is marked `raw`, `interpolated` or
  `extrapolated`, so a synthetic value is never silently mistaken for an observed one.
- **Declared precision.** Values are logically `BigDecimal`. Each aspect declares a
  physical encoding (`F64`, `F32`, `ScaledI64`, `ScaledI128`, `Decimal128`,
  `BigDecimalText`) and an error bound; a value the encoding cannot represent within
  that bound is rejected rather than quietly rounded.
- **Typed columnar segment store** (`.weftseg`) on the measurement hot path, with
  bit-packing, delta-of-delta timestamp coding and a transposed value layout, over a
  Turso (libSQL) control plane for catalog, metadata and the segment index.
- **Downsampling** with mergeable partial reductions (`.weftpart` sidecars), including
  time-weighted averages, over an epoch-aligned bucket grid.
- **Apache Arrow interchange** — sealed segments to `RecordBatch` and back, plus Arrow
  IPC and Parquet bytes.
- **HTTP API** (`weft-server`) covering health/readiness, ingest, query, interpolation,
  storage management, backup/restore and a restore drill, with OpenTelemetry tracing.
- **Terminal UI** (`weft-tui`) for exploring and administering an instance.
- **Weft-Bench** (`weft-bench`), a reproducible, correctness-gated benchmark harness.
- **Analytics pipeline** (`weft-orchestration`) chaining batching, pattern extraction,
  event detection, correlation and signal generation.
- Pre-built `weft-server`, `weft-tui` and `weft-bench` binaries for Linux, macOS and
  Windows (x86_64 and arm64) attached to every GitHub release.

### Changed

- **The workspace now builds on stable Rust** (1.95+). The `#![feature(stmt_expr_attributes)]`
  gate is gone, so nightly is no longer required to build, test or depend on any crate.
  Only `cargo fmt` still uses nightly, because `rustfmt.toml` sets nightly-only options.
- **Crates renamed for publication.** The core crate is now `weftdb` (was `database`,
  a name already taken on crates.io) and the pipeline crate is `weft-orchestration`
  (was `database_orchestration`). Import paths change accordingly:
  `use database::…` becomes `use weftdb::…`, and `use database_orchestration::…`
  becomes `use weft_orchestration::…`.

### Internal

- `splimes`' unit-test tree is now gated behind `#[cfg(test)]` instead of compiling
  into released library builds.
- Dropped unused `splimes` dependencies (`flume`, `num_cpus`, `futures`,
  `futures-channel`, `pollster`, and `rand` outside dev builds).
