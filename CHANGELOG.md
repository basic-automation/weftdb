# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the project is pre-1.0, minor version bumps may contain breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`splimes` moved to its own repository** ([basic-automation/splimes](https://github.com/basic-automation/splimes))
  and is now a crates.io dependency (`splimes = "0.1"`). It is released on its own
  schedule, and a stable WeftDB waits on a stable splimes.
- **Turso control plane upgraded 0.6 → 0.8.** ⚠️ This is one-way: once 0.8 writes a
  store, its MVCC log is v3 and an older WeftDB can no longer open it. Back up the
  control plane before upgrading.
- **`.weftpart` sidecars use `postcard` instead of `bincode`** (frame v3). Sidecars
  written by older versions are ignored: the segment is decoded instead, and the
  sidecar is rebuilt on the next seal. No data migration is needed.
- All dependencies updated to their latest major versions, including wgpu 30,
  Arrow/Parquet 60 and OpenTelemetry 0.33.
- Builds on stable Rust (MSRV 1.95); nightly is no longer required.

### Added

- `Database::list_stored_databases()` lists the legacy databases on disk (the folders
  of the data directory that hold a `metadata.db`), sweeping the build directories of
  interrupted `Database::new` calls first. `weft-tui` lists databases through it.

### Fixed

- **`Database::new` could leave a half-created database** that neither a retry of
  `new` ("already exists") nor `Database::existing` (no `database` row) could use. A
  database is now built in a hidden `.{name}.creating-{nonce}` folder beside its final
  place and renamed to `{name}` only once its schema and `database` row are committed,
  then the data directory is fsynced. An error or crash leaves either nothing under
  `{name}` (retry `new`) or the complete database (open it with `existing`). Build
  folders left by a crash are removed by the next `new` or listing; the data directory
  gains a `.weft-creating.lock` file that keeps a sweep away from a creation in
  progress, in this or another process. `new` now refuses a name of the build folders'
  form (`.{x}.creating-` followed by 32 hex digits).
- **Legacy ingest could store rows that were never batched.** `batch_capture_measurements`
  and `capture_measurement` queued the timestamps for batching only after the rows
  committed, so a failure in between left rows the incremental pipeline never saw.
  The timestamps are now queued first, so the queue always covers the stored rows; a
  timestamp whose row never landed waits in the queue, and the incremental build no
  longer fails on an aspect whose queue holds timestamps but no rows yet. Updating the
  aspect's earliest/latest columns after the insert is now best-effort, like the
  dirty-region marking, so it cannot fail a call whose rows are already stored.
- **A crashed batch consumer queued its batches twice.** `insert_unprocessed_batch` and
  `batch_insert_unprocessed_batches` now skip a batch whose `(aspect_id, batch_hash)` is
  already queued or processed, so re-running the incremental build after a crash before
  its dequeue adds no duplicate batches or pattern occurrences. Processed batches keep
  the hash they were queued under (it used to be recomputed from the processed
  measurements).
- Two rows-mode ingest residuals remain until aspects move to the segment store, and
  are now documented on `batch_capture_measurements`: an error mid-call leaves the
  chunks committed before it, and retrying stores those rows again.
- **Commit failures were silently ignored.** A control-plane write that lost an MVCC
  conflict was reported as success. Commit errors now reach the caller, and the
  transaction is rolled back.
- **Quadratic GPU interpolation failed on GPUs without f64 support** (Apple Silicon,
  most integrated GPUs, Windows WARP). The f32 fallback shader did not parse, so wgpu
  panicked.

### Security

- Cleared the `crossbeam-epoch` (RUSTSEC-2026-0204) and `h2` (RUSTSEC-2026-0258)
  advisories, replaced the unmaintained `bincode` (RUSTSEC-2025-0141), and removed the
  unsound `lru` 0.16 (RUSTSEC-2026-0253) by disabling turso's unused full-text search.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-25

First public release. WeftDB is pre-beta: the API will change, and the version
number says so.

### Added

- **Interpolation as a first-class query.** Ask for any resolution and get back a
  continuous series, reconstructed with the spline method you choose (linear,
  quadratic, cubic, polynomial), computed on SIMD/parallel CPU or GPU (`wgpu`).
- **Provenance labelling.** Every returned point is marked `raw`, `interpolated` or
  `extrapolated`, so a synthetic value is never silently mistaken for an observed one.
- **Declared precision.** Values are logically `BigDecimal`. Each aspect declares a
  physical encoding (`F64`, `F32`, `ScaledI64`, `ScaledI128`, `Decimal128`,
  `BigDecimalText`) and an error bound; a value the encoding cannot represent within
  that bound is rejected rather than quietly rounded.
- **Typed columnar segment store** (`.weftseg`) on the measurement hot path, with
  bit-packing, delta-of-delta timestamp coding and a transposed value layout, over a
  Turso (libSQL) control plane for catalog, metadata and the segment index.
- **Downsampling** with mergeable partial reductions (`.weftpart` sidecars), including
  time-weighted averages, over an epoch-aligned bucket grid.
- **Apache Arrow interchange** — sealed segments to `RecordBatch` and back, plus Arrow
  IPC and Parquet bytes.
- **HTTP API** (`weft-server`) covering health/readiness, ingest, query, interpolation,
  storage management, backup/restore and a restore drill, with OpenTelemetry tracing.
- **Terminal UI** (`weft-tui`) for exploring and administering an instance.
- **Weft-Bench** (`weft-bench`), a reproducible, correctness-gated benchmark harness.
- **Analytics pipeline** (`weft-orchestration`) chaining batching, pattern extraction,
  event detection, correlation and signal generation.
- Pre-built `weft-server`, `weft-tui` and `weft-bench` binaries for Linux, macOS and
  Windows (x86_64 and arm64) attached to every GitHub release.

### Changed

- **The workspace now builds on stable Rust** (1.95+). The `#![feature(stmt_expr_attributes)]`
  gate is gone, so nightly is no longer required to build, test or depend on any crate.
  Only `cargo fmt` still uses nightly, because `rustfmt.toml` sets nightly-only options.
- **Crates renamed for publication.** The core crate is now `weftdb` (was `database`,
  a name already taken on crates.io) and the pipeline crate is `weft-orchestration`
  (was `database_orchestration`). Import paths change accordingly:
  `use database::…` becomes `use weftdb::…`, and `use database_orchestration::…`
  becomes `use weft_orchestration::…`.

### Internal

- `splimes`' unit-test tree is now gated behind `#[cfg(test)]` instead of compiling
  into released library builds.
- Dropped unused `splimes` dependencies (`flume`, `num_cpus`, `futures`,
  `futures-channel`, `pollster`, and `rand` outside dev builds).
